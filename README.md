# My 2018 goals
I want 2018 to be a good year, so I'm setting some goals and keeping track of them. I think making this public will put a bit of pressure on me to get things done too ðŸš€.

Each item has an issue attached for more info and a log of what's been achieved so far. Hopefully in December 2018, I can write a post about how I've succeeded in all the below points ðŸ™‚.

## The goals
- [ ] Publish at-least 20 articles ([#1](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/2018-goals/issues/1))
- [x] Speak at at-least one conference or meetup ([#2](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/2018-goals/issues/2))
- [ ] Feature in at-least 1 podcast as a guest ([#3](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/2018-goals/issues/3))
- [ ] Get my weight to 13.5 stone (86kg) and maintain it ([#4](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/2018-goals/issues/4))
